European Union officials granted approval despite concerns about its banking system and Latvia is expected to replace its national currency, the lat, on January 1, 2014. EU leaders said the Baltic state's willingness to join next year is a vote of confidence for the shared currency. Latvia is expected to replace its currency, the Lat, with the Euro by January 1, 2014 A final decision will be made by eurozone finance ministers July 9 - following further consultation among EU leaders and Parliament. The 17 countries that use the Euro are struggling with a crisis over too much government debt, a recession, and 12.2 per cent unemployment. Olli Rehn, the EU's top economic and monetary official, said today that Latvia's membership bid was 'further evidence that those who predicted the disintegration of the euro area were wrong.' Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis tweeted that the decision was 'the next step for growth.' However, many of Latvia's 2million population are skeptical of the need to join in the midst of the eurozone's debt troubles. Anti-Euro parties won more than half the vote in local elections in the capital, Riga, last weekend. Euro opponent Andris Orols, head of 'Latvia for the Lat,' vowed to ask the constitutional court to review the government's decision. 'We are against the euro because we believe that an independent and sovereign country cannot exist without its own money which it controls,' he said. Latvia committed to join the euro in 2004 when it joined the European Union. Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis (second row, third from left, pictured with European leaders) announced the single currency news over Twitter Valdis Dombrovskis tweeted that the decision was 'the next step for growth' Under the EU's treaty, all EU members must adopt the euro eventually although it can take years to meet the tough requirements. The only exceptions are Britain and Denmark, which were given opt-outs. Latvia and its Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Estonia are keen to strengthen ties with Western Europe and reduce their dependency on Russia. To join the single currency, Latvia had to show the EU that it could control inflation, deficits and government debt, and keep its currency in a narrow exchange rate range with the euro. Compared with heavily indebted Euro countries such as Greece, Portugal and Italy, its government finances are in good shape. Its budget deficit at the end of 2012 was 1.2 per cent of annual economic output, well below the EU's 3 per cent limit. Its debt burden was 41 per cent of output, less than the 60 per cent requirement and far less than the Eurozone average of 91 per cent. Its economy would be the third-smallest, larger only than those of Cyprus and Malta. With annual output of about 22.3 billion euros ($29 billion) it would account for just 0.2 per cent of the overall eurozone economy. Economic benefits of joining the euro include not having the costs and inconvenience of exchanging one currency for another while travelling or doing business across borders. However, Latvia will not be able to independently raise of lower its interest rates to deal with an economic slowdown or excessive inflation. here is just one benchmark interest rate set for all euro members by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, based on the needs of the entire Eurozone economy. European Central Bank said Latvia would need to exercise continued vigilance to make sure inflation stayed under control and that its banks were strong enough Euro members also cannot devalue their currency to boost exports, as a way of adjusting to an economic downturn or crisis. Latvia has won praise from the EU and international finance officials for pushing through required reforms - mainly cuts to wages and government spending - to make its economy more competitive. That put Latvians through several years of austerity. It also came soon after a profound recession in 2008-2010, when the economy shrank about 25 per cent as a credit-fuelled real estate boom collapsed. The economy has since returned to strong growth, expanding 5.6 per cent in 2012. In a separate assessment, the European Central Bank said that Latvia would need to exercise continued vigilance to make sure inflation stayed under control and that its banks were strong enough. It called non-resident deposits 'an important risk to financial stability.'\",\n \"European Commission granted approval for Latvia to join the Euro .
